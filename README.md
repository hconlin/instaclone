# NetEngine Ruby on Rails Technical Challenge

## InstaClone

Thanks for your interest in The Scout Talent Group. We are excited that you are interested in joining us as a Ruby on Rails developer.
Congratulations! You have made it to the next round: a coding challenge.

### The Challenge

This challenge involves extending an Instagram clone in Rails. You should add the following feature to the app:

1. Friends
   1. Users should be able to send a friend request to other users
   2. Users should be able to see a list of friend requests
   3. Users should be able to accept or decline friend requests
   4. Users should be able to see a list of any userâ€™s friends

### Additional information:
1. Frontend using **Haml** or **Erb**, _without_ **css**
2. No limit on gem usage
3. Do **not** spend more than 120 minutes on your implementation. You do not need to complete all the steps. We are evaluating what you can do in this timeframe and the quality of your work, not necessarily the quantity of code.
   We are looking for well structured and written code, following current Rails best practices. We will not evaluate your view logic. Testing is not a necessity, but will score you bonus points.
